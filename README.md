# Alberth Portfolio

The idea of this project is to be in addition to a personal presentation and my main projects 
to be a **Personal Blog** where I can share my knowledge and experiences with the community.

I intend to bring you all kinds of fun experiences and tips that I find along this road of development

Everything is still at a very early stage and I don't have much time to dedicate to it (at least not for now), but whenever I can I'll work on the back and front

I hope you enjoy it and that it can be useful to you in some way
